"""L1 correctness for ``tlx.ops.mm``.

Runs the synthetic list plus this arch's focus list -- the same set the perf
suite measures. Shapes live in ``triton.tlx.ops.kernels.mm._shapes``, so one
disabled for a correctness bug is automatically not benchmarked either.

A shape the op declines (sm100 requires 16-byte-aligned TMA strides; gfx942 has
no such constraint) is reported as a skip with the reason, never as a pass.
